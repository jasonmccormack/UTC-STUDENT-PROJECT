If you head into the Master files, Domains, you can add domain names, and add descriptions to them. Under Job role groups you can add and delete the groups using the 'Add job role group' and delete them by selecting 'Delete selected job groups' from the  action drop down menu. Similiar to the Job role groups, under job roles you can add and remove  job roles with the same method used above. Under the header leave type, as an admin you can create leave status and add a description to it.   As an admin you can add a leave calender.
